          Whether it be person to person, business to consumer, or an individual
          to their interests, technology is meant to bring us closer to what we
          care about in the best way possible. Arc Development will use that
          principle to provide fast, modern, inexpensive, and aesthetic software
          to the Midwest and beyond.

                It all started with one question: Why aren’t all businesses
                using available technology? There are many different answers to
                that question: economic barriers, social barriers, educational
                barriers, and sometimes institutional barriers.

                We aim to be a powerful force in overcoming these obstacles.
                Recent developments in software engineering and computing power,
                compounded by the proliferation of smart phones, has opened up
                infinite worlds of possibility. Things that have always been
                done by hand can now be done digitally and automatically, and
                completely new methods of interaction are created daily. Taking
                full advantage of these advancements is the name of the game.
